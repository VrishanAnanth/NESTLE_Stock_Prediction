# NESTLE_Stock_Prediction

I use various financial analysis techniques and run basic regression to know overall stock performance, and then use a Time Series model (ARIMA Model) to predict
future stock price of NESTLE and NTPC.

This project was a part of my course in college: Fincancial Risk Analytics and Management and I did it under the guidance of my Finance professor 
Dr. Nagaraju Thota
